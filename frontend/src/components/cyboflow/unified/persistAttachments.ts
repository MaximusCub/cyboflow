/**
 * Composer attachment persistence — turns the composer-owned images / large
 * pasted texts into on-disk files and folds their absolute paths into the
 * outgoing message body.
 *
 * Every agent surface in the app consumes attachments the same way: the files
 * are written under `CYBOFLOW_DIR/artifacts/<ownerId>/` and the message carries
 * an `<attachments>` block listing the paths, which the agent then reads with
 * its own file tools. There is NO binary transport — the SDK/PTY send paths are
 * plain text, so the path list IS the attachment.
 *
 * `ownerId` is the artifacts-dir key: a session id for quick-session chat, or a
 * WORKFLOW RUN id for the run-chat composer and the question gate (the main
 * process accepts either — see `assertAttachmentOwner` in ipc/session.ts).
 *
 * Unlike useClaudePanel's inline copies, a persistence failure REJECTS instead
 * of sending the text without its attachments: UnifiedComposer keeps the
 * attachments on a rejected submit, so the user can retry rather than discover
 * later that the screenshot they were pointing at never arrived.

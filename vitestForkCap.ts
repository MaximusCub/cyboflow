/**
 * Gate-run-time resolution of the vitest fork-pool size, shared by
 * `main/vitest.config.ts` and `frontend/vitest.config.ts`.
 *
 * The policy lives in `shared/types/testConcurrency.ts`; this module supplies the
 * only impure inputs — how many vitest gates are running on this machine RIGHT
 * NOW, and how many ABANDONED pool workers are still holding cores — and is the
 * reason the cap is computed here rather than baked into the agent environment at
 * spawn time. See that module's header for the full why.
 *
 * ORPHANED WORKERS. A fork whose root was hard-killed keeps running (macOS has no
 * PDEATHSIG; see `vitestOrphanWatchdog.ts`). Such a fork is titled
 * `node (vitest N)`, NOT `node (vitest)` — so the gate count this module has
 * always produced skipped it entirely, and a runaway fork pinning a core
 * contributed nothing to the concurrency the cap divides by. That is the exact
 * blind spot that let two orphans pin two cores and ~2 GB for 24 minutes while the
 * next gate sized its pool as though the box were idle. They are now both REAPED
 * (when policy allows) and, for any that survive, COUNTED as cores this run does
 * not have.
 *
 * Every path is fail-soft: if `ps` is unavailable (Windows, a locked-down CI
 * image, a sandbox), we report a single gate and no orphans, which resolves to
 * vitest's normal parallelism — never an error and never a hang. A kill that
 * throws is swallowed the same way.

/**
 * Orphan-watchdog unit tests.
 *
 * Driven through the injected title/thread/spawn seams — no thread is started and
 * nothing is killed. The regressions that matter here are the ones where arming is
 * WRONG: a vitest root must never self-terminate, a `threads`-pool worker must
 * never be judged by its process ppid, and a detached (`nohup`) run must survive —
 * each of those would turn a healthy gate into a self-inflicted kill.
 *
 * The behaviour that cannot be unit-tested is the one that motivated the design:
 * that the watchdog still fires when the main thread is wedged in libuv's check
 * phase and no main-thread callback can run. That was verified against a live
 * orphan — see the module header.

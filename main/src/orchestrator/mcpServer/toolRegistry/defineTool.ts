/**
 * One tool, declared once.
 *
 * Before this registry a `cyboflow_*` tool lived in three hand-maintained
 * places — a JSON Schema literal in the ListTools reply, a `case` arm that
 * re-typechecked the same fields by hand and built the socket envelope, and the
 * `McpQueryMessage` union member the main process reads — with nothing tying
 * them together. `defineTool` collapses the first two onto one zod schema and,
 * more importantly, TYPECHECKS the third: `toEnvelope` must return exactly
 * {@link EnvelopeParams} for the envelope the entry names.
 *
 * That last part closes a real hole. The envelope crosses the orch socket as
 * JSON and is re-typed by a blind `parsed as McpQueryMessage` cast
 * (orchSocketServer.ts), so before this a mis-renamed camelCase key — say
 * `taskId` written as `task_id` — compiled, shipped, and arrived at the handler
 * as `undefined`. Now it is a build error at the definition site.
 *
 * The import of `McpQueryMessage` is TYPE-ONLY on purpose: this module is
 * bundled into the standalone MCP subprocess by scripts/bundle-mcp-server.mjs,
 * and a value import of mcpQueryHandler would drag the entire main process
 * (electron, better-sqlite3, the services layer) in with it.

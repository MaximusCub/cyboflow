/**
 * Per-run bearer tokens for the orchestrator Unix socket (orch.sock).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * `OrchSocketServer` binds a connection to a run the first time that connection
 * sends an envelope carrying a `runId` (see `orchSocketServer.bindSocket`).
 * Before this module the runId was purely SELF-DECLARED: any local process that
 * could open the socket path could claim any run — including the global agent's
 * `agent:<threadId>` identity, which unlocks the cross-project filesystem/SQL
 * read family — and inherit that run's powers (shell-approval routing, entity
 * writes, workflow-spec edits).
 *
 * A token closes that: the orchestrator mints one random secret per runId at
 * SPAWN time, hands it to the processes it spawns for that run via the
 * `CYBOFLOW_ORCH_TOKEN` env var, and the server refuses a bind whose token does
 * not match.
 *
 * INVARIANTS
 * ----------
 *  - **Memory only.** Tokens live in this process's heap for the app's lifetime
 *    and are never written to disk, never logged, and never sent to the
 *    renderer. Every transport that carries one (`claudeCodeManager`'s in-memory
 *    MCP entry, `interactiveClaudeManager`'s PTY env, the Codex app-server
 *    config, OMP's bare-name env indirection) is in-memory by construction —
 *    deliberately NOT the on-disk `.mcp.json` / `interactive-mcp.json` /
 *    `.omp/mcp.json` files those substrates also write. The Claude CLI passes
 *    its full process env down to stdio MCP servers, which is what lets the
 *    interactive substrate's config stay token-free.
 *  - **Idempotent per runId.** `mint` returns the SAME token for a runId it has
 *    already seen. Re-minting would break a warm SDK session (the options
 *    fingerprint would churn) and orphan an already-spawned client.
 *  - **Standalone-typecheck safe.** Imports nothing but `node:crypto`, so
 *    `orchSocketServer.ts` (which must not reach electron / better-sqlite3 /
 *    services) can depend on it.
 *
 * THREAT MODEL, honestly stated: the socket itself is chmodded 0600 and its
 * directory 0700, so the only processes that can reach it already run as this
 * user. The token is defense-in-depth on top of that — it stops a same-user
 * process (a stray agent, a leftover subprocess from another run, anything that
 * merely knows the socket path) from ASSERTING a run identity that is not its
 * own. It is not a defense against an attacker who already controls this user.

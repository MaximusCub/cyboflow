/**
 * Self-termination for vitest fork-pool workers whose root has died.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A vitest fork-pool worker is an ordinary child process with no
 * lifetime link to its parent. macOS has no `PDEATHSIG` (Linux-only), and
 * tinypool's pool teardown — the thing that would normally kill the workers — only
 * runs if the ROOT exits gracefully. In agent contexts the root is essentially
 * never allowed to: the Claude harness abandons a Bash command after ~180s with no
 * output (and vitest is silent for long stretches), a stopped session hard-kills
 * the tree, and cyboflow's own teardown is a `killProcessTree` SIGKILL. A SIGKILL'd
 * root cannot clean up after itself, so its workers are adopted by launchd and keep
 * running. Two were observed holding ~2 GB and two cores for 24 minutes, which
 * pushed a 16 GB box to 79 MB free and 13.9 GB of swap.
 *
 * WHY THIS RUNS ON A SEPARATE THREAD — the part that is not obvious, and that a
 * plain `setInterval` gets wrong. When the root dies, the worker's IPC channel
 * breaks and the resulting uncaught exception wedges the process inside the libuv
 * CHECK phase, re-entering V8's own stack-trace formatter forever. Sampled stack
 * of a real orphan:
 *
 *     uv_run -> uv__run_check -> CheckImmediate -> ReportPendingMessages
 *            -> TriggerUncaughtException -> ErrorStackGetter -> FormatStackTrace -> ...
 *
 * The loop never advances to `uv__run_timers`, so NO main-thread JS callback can
 * ever run again — not a timer, not `process.on('disconnect')`, not an exit hook.
 * Both were tried against a live orphan and neither fired. A `worker_threads`
 * watchdog has its own isolate and event loop on its own OS thread, so it keeps
 * ticking while the main thread is wedged, and `process.kill(pid, 'SIGKILL')` from
 * it takes down the whole process regardless. Verified end to end: a process spun
 * up at 98% CPU in an infinite loop self-terminated within 1s of being orphaned.
 *
 * COST. The extra isolate measures ~12 MB RSS per worker. That is paid only while
 * a gate is running, and under managed mode — the case that actually produces
 * orphans — the fork cap is small (see `shared/types/testConcurrency.ts`), so it is
 * tens of MB against the ~2 GB a single orphan pair costs.
 *
 * SAFETY. Arming is gated on two independently-verified facts (see
 * {@link isForkPoolWorker}), and the orphan test itself is `ppid === 1`, which is a
 * proof rather than a heuristic: a live worker always has its root as parent. A
 * deliberately detached run (`nohup pnpm test:unit &`) reparents the ROOT, which is
 * titled `node (vitest)` and never matches the worker pattern.
 *
 * This is the innermost of three layers; `vitestForkCap.ts` reaps at gate start and
 * `VitestOrphanReaper` sweeps from the main process.
